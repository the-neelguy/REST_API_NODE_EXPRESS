REST API - JSON

1. GET /api/car - Give the list of car

2. GET /api/car/1 - Get the details of car with ID as 1
   GET /api/car/2 - Get the details of car with ID as 2



3. POST /api/car - Create a new car

4. PATCH /api/car/1 - Edit the car with ID = 1

5. DELETE /api/car/3 - Delete the car with ID = 3


---- So, the /api/car is used to see raw JSON data in the server which can be further used for development.

                                                AND

---- But the /car is used for normal users which will render a HTML page to show the same data in HTML format (frontend)
